# My_scripts
Compilation of scripts and programming notes. My aim is to create a quick source of useful lines/functions/scripts for different
languages/programs. The content will range from basics to specific solutions.

## Formatting
So long, the only rule is to add simple self-explanatory comments to the lines/functions/scripts. There is a lack of a generalized formatting on this repository
which makes it look quite chaotic.
